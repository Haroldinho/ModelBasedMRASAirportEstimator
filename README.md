# Model based estimation of queueing parameters for airport ground traffic

Discrete-Event Simulation Analysis of Arrival Passenger Flow at Sydney International Airport

The work consists of two parts:
- a simple simulation of arrival passenger traffic at SYD from the time a flight arrives at the gate to the time a passenger leaves passport control
- a model-based estimation tool to infer the best parameter for the service rate distribution at the different immigration servers based on the simulation
